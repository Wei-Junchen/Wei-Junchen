## Hi there 👋  

I'm **Wei Junchen**

I am a **CS student / beginner-level developer** who is currently learning **C/C++ and systems programming**.  
My main focus is on building a solid foundation: understanding **how languages work**, how programs are **compiled and executed**, and how to write **clear and correct code**.

I am still early in my journey, but I enjoy digging into details and learning things from first principles rather than only using high-level abstractions.

### 🌱 Currently Learning

- C++ fundamentals and modern language features (templates, concepts, value categories)
- Basic compile-time mechanisms and type-system behavior
- Linear algebra basics for graphics and simulation (vectors, matrices, quaternions)
- Performance awareness and low-level cost models
- Linux-based development workflows

### 📌 What You’ll Find Here

- Learning-oriented C++ experiments and small projects  
- Self-written math utilities for practice and understanding  
- Notes and demos related to compilation, linking, and runtime behavior  
- Occasional Python scripts for experimentation and analysis

Most repositories here are **practice-driven** and may evolve as I learn more.

### 🧭 Personal Approach

- Focus on **fundamentals over buzzwords**
- Try to understand **why things work**, not just how to use them
- Accept imperfect code as part of the learning process
- Improve gradually through iteration and reflection
